  numpy
      `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ is the standard numerical
      array library for python, the successor to Numeric and numarray.
      numpy provides fast operations for homogeneous data sets and
      common mathematical operations like correlations, standard
      deviation, fourier transforms, and convolutions.
