Phynx

============
Introduction
============

Phynx is a high-level interface to HDF5 files, using the h5py bindings to the
the HDF5 library. HDF5 is an open-source binary format designed for scientific
data, it allows you to organize your data in an hierarchy similar to a
filesystem. It is fair to think of HDF5 as a file system for large, complex
data. Phynx provides access to such datasets without storing the entire file in
memory, thus it is easy to work with multi-gigabyte files on a computer with
limited RAM.

Phynx offers additional object oriented routines designed to make it easier to
work with the kind of data generated at synchrotron labs. Its organization is
inspired in part by the NeXus_ format. The NeXus application programming
interface is somewhat onerous on both the developer and the user, and the
standard NeXus hierarchy is in some ways too cumbersome and constrictive for
many applications. Nevertheless, the NeXus project has the laudable goal of
bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical research initiatives, and
phynx does not intend to subvert the NeXus project. Rather, phynx is designed to
provide a simple organization for synchrotron data, around which the standard
NeXus hierarchy and full instrument definition can be built at a later time, if
so desired. The phynx routines are designed to provide an interface to your data
that is hopefully intuitive and simple to use.

Exporting data
==============

Naturally, you will feel more comfortable storing your data in the HDF5 format
if you understand how to get it back out. Imagine you have a file with the
following standard format::

  mydata.h5
    /entry_1/measurement/scalar_data/motor_1
                                     motor_2
                                     ion_chamber_1
                        /MCA/counts
                             deadtime

and you want to export channels 500-550 of the first three MCA spectra to an
ASCII text file. You can do so with the following simple python code, which can
be run as a script or in an interactive session::

  from xpaxs.io.phynx import File
  import numpy

  f = File('mydata.h5')
  mca_spectra = f['/entry_1/measurement/MCA/counts'][:3, 500:551]
  numpy.savetxt('mca_spectra.txt', mca_spectra, fmt='%g')

Since we didnt need any of phynx special features, I could have done
`from h5py import File` instead.

If you don't know how to run a python script, try reading the tutorial_ at the
`python website`_. For working with data interactively, have a look at the
IPython_ package. If you don't know what `fmt='%g'` meant, you can find an
explanation in the python documentation for `string formatting`_.
